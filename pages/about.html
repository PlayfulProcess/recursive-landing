            <h2 class="section-title">Why I Built This (The Mati & Dada Moment)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                A while back, my daughter was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArtwithMatiDada" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline font-medium"><em>Mati & Dada</em></a>—a gentle art-history cartoon.
                On their YouTube channel, there was a link to the old official website.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>One click away from that beloved kids' show… was soft porn.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The domain had been hijacked after being abandoned. Technically, it was "just bots repurposing an old URL." But as a parent, the mechanism doesn't matter. The risk does.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Around the same time, my own old domain was quietly turned into gambling links.
                I realized: <strong>the web forgets what things were "meant" to be. Links decay. Algorithms don't care. Children are not the intended audience of this infrastructure.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                So I built a small thing:
            </p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <a href="https://www.recursive.eco/view/1860e65c-d7de-4a14-8919-b35e6ef2f521" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline font-semibold">Creator.Recursive.Eco</a> — a tool to watch YouTube in a calmer way:<br>
                no thumbnails, no algorithm, no rabbit holes. Just curated sequences you control.
            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                You can:

                <li>Discover curated playlists and kids' stories</li>
                <li>Make your own mixed sequences (videos, images, text)</li>
                <li>Share them with others, if you want</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                It doesn't replace supervision, and it's still just a browser.
                But it creates a safer middle ground between "full YouTube" and "no screen at all."
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>That was the first loop of recursive gratitude:</strong> something scary happened, I learned from it, and then tried to give something back.

            <h2 class="section-title">Why It's Open Source & "Recursive"</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I'm deeply influenced by the Free Software movement, especially Christopher Kelty's idea of a <strong>"recursive public"</strong>:
            </p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                A public that cares not only about sharing ideas,<br>
                but about maintaining and modifying the tools and infrastructure that let it exist at all.
            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                In practice, that means:

                <li>The platform code and content structure are open and forkable.</li>

                <li>Improvements don't just benefit "me"—they can benefit everyone downstream.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                I'm inspired by recursive models like:

                <li><strong>Ghost</strong> – open-source software, funded by paid hosting, that keeps the code free.</li>
                <li><strong>Vercel & Supabase</strong> – generous free tiers that let small experiments (like this one) exist at all.</li>
                <li><strong>Open source developers & consultants</strong> – people who give away tools, then make a living helping others use them well.</li>
            </ul>

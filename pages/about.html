            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                On Recursive.eco, recursiveness means looping through this process on purpose:

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why This Exists (The Mati & Dada Moment)</h2>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Children watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArtwithMatiDada" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline font-medium">Mati & Dada</a>—a gentle art-history cartoon—might find a link on the YouTube channel to what appears to be the official website.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-900 font-semibold mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                One click away from that beloved kids' show… was soft porn.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The domain had been hijacked after being abandoned. Technically, it was "just bots repurposing an old URL." But when children's safety is at stake, the mechanism doesn't matter. The risk does.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This isn't unique to Mati & Dada. Domains expire, get hijacked, redirect to gambling sites or worse. The web forgets what things were "meant" to be. Links decay. Algorithms don't care. Children are not the intended audience of this infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This recognition led to building a tool:
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6 pl-4 border-l-4 border-purple-400 leading-relaxed">
                <a href="https://www.recursive.eco/view/1860e65c-d7de-4a14-8919-b35e6ef2f521" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline font-semibold">Creator.Recursive.Eco</a> — a tool to watch YouTube in a calmer way: no thumbnails, no algorithm, no rabbit holes. Just curated sequences you control.

                <li>Sharing these sequences with communities</li>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                This doesn't replace vigilance, and it's still just a browser. But it creates a safer middle ground between unrestricted access and complete prohibition.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 font-medium leading-relaxed">
                That was the first loop of recursive practice: identifying a systemic problem, learning from it, and offering a tool back to the commons.

        <!-- Why It's Open Source & "Recursive" -->
        <section class="mb-16">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why It's Open Source & "Recursive"</h2>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I'm deeply influenced by the Free Software movement, especially Christopher Kelty's idea of a "recursive public":
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 italic mb-6 pl-4 border-l-4 border-purple-400">
                A public that cares not only about sharing ideas, but about maintaining and modifying the tools and infrastructure that let it exist at all.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                In practice, that means:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-6 mb-8 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>The platform code and content structure are open and forkable.</li>
                <li>You can copy this site, host your own version, and adapt it.</li>
                <li>Improvements don't just benefit "me"—they can benefit everyone downstream.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                I'm inspired by recursive models like:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-6 mb-8 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Ghost</span> – open-source software, funded by paid hosting, that keeps the code free.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Vercel & Supabase</span> – generous free tiers that let small experiments (like this one) exist at all.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Open source developers & consultants</span> – people who give away tools, then make a living helping others use them well.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
                Recursive.eco is my small translation of that pattern into the worlds of:

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-6 space-y-1 text-lg">
                <li>kids & parents,</li>
                <li>mental health & meaning, and</li>

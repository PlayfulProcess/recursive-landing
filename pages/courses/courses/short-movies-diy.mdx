## Step 1: Write Your Story (10-15m)

### Create your story or poem

Use the [StoryCrafter GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67f5f3bbadcc8191b3f2ec0ee4dfd79d-storycrafter-gpt) to write a short story or poem.

**Tips for your story:**
- Keep it short (5-10 sentences or stanzas)
- Ensure your story can be easily visualized
- Think about what images would represent each part
- Make it suitable for narration

**Example prompt for StoryCrafter:**
> Write a short poem about a child discovering magic in their backyard. Make it visual and suitable for a 1-minute video.

### Break your story into scenes

Once you have your story, break it into separate scenes or sentences. Each scene should represent a distinct visual moment.

**Example:**
- Scene 1: "A child looks out the window at their backyard"
- Scene 2: "They notice a glowing butterfly"
- Scene 3: "Following it, they discover a hidden garden"

**Key goal:** Aim for visual consistency among images for a cohesive storytelling experience.

**Example prompt:**

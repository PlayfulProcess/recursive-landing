## Step 1: Write Your Story (10-15m)

### Create your story or poem

Use the [StoryCrafter GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67f5f3bbadcc8191b3f2ec0ee4dfd79d-storycrafter-gpt) to write a short story or poem.

**Tips for your story:**
- Keep it short (5-10 sentences or stanzas)
- Ensure your story can be easily visualized
- Think about what images would represent each part
- Make it suitable for narration

**Example prompt for StoryCrafter:**
> Write a short poem about a child discovering magic in their backyard. Make it visual and suitable for a 1-minute video.

### Break your story into scenes

Once you have your story, break it into separate scenes or sentences. Each scene should represent a distinct visual moment.

**Example:**
- Scene 1: "A child looks out the window at their backyard"
- Scene 2: "They notice a glowing butterfly"
- Scene 3: "Following it, they discover a hidden garden"

## Step 2: Generate Your Images (15-20m)

### Create image prompts

Use the [AI Story Image Creator GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67f5f79c0e3881918b763e863c2dc206-ai-story-image-creator) to create detailed prompts for generating images.

**Key goal:** Aim for visual consistency among images for a cohesive storytelling experience.

**Example prompt:**
> Create image prompts for my story about a child discovering magic. Use a consistent art style - watercolor illustration with soft colors. Here's my story: [paste your story]

### Download and organize your images

- Generate each image using the prompts
- Download each image to your computer
- **Number them clearly** (e.g., scene01.jpg, scene02.jpg, scene03.jpg)
- Keep them in a dedicated folder for your project

**Note:** This step is optional but adds polish to your final video!

  - Images (in order)
  - Video transition clips (if created)
- Arrange them on the timeline to match your narration
- Add simple transitions between images if needed
- Preview and adjust timing
- Export your final video

**Video Editor Tips:**
- Start with the audio track to set the timing

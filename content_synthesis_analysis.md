# Content Synthesis Analysis for Jongu Landing Pages

## Goal: Reduce total text by at least 50%, ideally to 10% of current content

## Current Content Analysis

### Main Page (index.html) - Key Sections:
1. **Hero Section** - Recursive kindness explanation
2. **Theoretical Foundation** - Christopher Kelty's recursive publics
3. **Explore Channels** - Wellness channel + Best Possible Self tool  
4. **What We're Building** - Future features (channels, tools, profiles)
5. **Help Shape** - How to contribute (GitHub, AI governance, Discord)

### About Page (about.html) - Key Sections:
1. **Hero/Intro** - What is Recursive.eco
2. **Core Tensions We Harmonize** - 4 tension pairs
3. **Operating Philosophy** - Technical/value decisions  
4. **Governance Principles** - Open Not Free framework
5. **Sustainability Model** - 4-column business model breakdown
6. **Recursive Logo** - Mathematical explanation + multi-rhythm
7. **AI Collaboration** - Building with Claude
8. **Join the Dance** - Call to action

## Identified Duplications & Redundancies:

### 1. **Recursive Kindness Definition** (MAJOR DUPLICATION)
- Main page: Long paragraph in hero section
- About page: Repeated in "What is Recursive.eco" section
**Recommendation**: Keep condensed version on main page only

### 2. **Technical/Moral Decision Philosophy** (DUPLICATION)  
- Main page: Brief mention
- About page: Detailed explanation
**Recommendation**: Keep brief version on main page, reference about page

### 3. **AI Governance Links** (DUPLICATION)
- Main page: "Help Shape" section with AI governance link
- About page: Dedicated AI governance section
**Recommendation**: Keep brief mention on main page, detailed on about

### 4. **Call to Action/Join** (DUPLICATION)
- Main page: Multiple CTAs throughout
- About page: "Join the Dance" section
**Recommendation**: Streamline to essential CTAs only

### 5. **Business Model Details** (OVER-EXPLAINED)
- About page: Massive 4-column detailed breakdown
**Recommendation**: Drastically condense or move to separate page

## Content Cutting Strategy:

### Phase 1: Remove Redundant Sections (50% reduction target)

#### From About Page:
1. **Cut**: Detailed business model section (lines 459-594) - Move to separate "sustainability.html" page
2. **Cut**: Detailed logo mathematics section (lines 596-655) - Keep brief version only  
3. **Cut**: Full AI collaboration section (lines 657-697) - Condense to 2-3 sentences
4. **Condense**: Governance section from 4 detailed pillars to brief principles
5. **Condense**: "Join the Dance" to simple CTA

#### From Main Page:
1. **Cut**: Theoretical foundation box - Move to about page only
2. **Condense**: "What We're Building" - Remove detailed descriptions, keep feature names only
3. **Condense**: "Help Shape" - Reduce to 3 simple options without long descriptions

### Phase 2: Synthesis Opportunities

#### Create Single Sources of Truth:
1. **Recursive Kindness**: Main page hero only
2. **Governance**: About page only, brief mention on main
3. **Business Model**: Separate page, brief mention on about
4. **Technical Philosophy**: About page only

#### Consolidate Similar Ideas:
1. Merge "Operating Philosophy" and "What is Recursive.eco" sections
2. Combine multiple contribution CTAs into single section
3. Streamline footer links (same on both pages)

## Recommended New Structure:

### Main Page (index.html) - Focus: Welcome & Explore
- Hero: Recursive kindness (condensed)
- Explore: Current tools
- Building: Future features (condensed list)  
- Contribute: Simple 3-option CTA

### About Page (about.html) - Focus: Philosophy & How We Work
- What We Are: Vision + recursive publics + tensions
- How We Work: Governance + technical philosophy
- Logo: Brief visual explanation
- Join: Simple CTA

### New Page: sustainability.html - Focus: Business Model
- Detailed sustainability breakdown
- Revenue streams
- Commons funding philosophy

## Expected Text Reduction:
- **Main page**: ~40% reduction (remove theoretical box, condense sections)
- **About page**: ~60% reduction (remove business model, condense logo/AI sections) 
- **Overall**: ~50% total reduction achieved

This aligns content with CLAUDE.md goal of cutting "total text amount by at least half" while maintaining essential information and improving information architecture.
